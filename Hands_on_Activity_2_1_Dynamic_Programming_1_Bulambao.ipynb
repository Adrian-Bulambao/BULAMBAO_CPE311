The solution to a subproblem is stored in each table entry and is subsequently utilized to calculate more complex issues.  This approach is effective in terms of execution speed and avoids recursion.  The top-down approach begins with the primary issue and, if necessary, divides it into smaller subproblems.  The computed results undergo another recursion after being saved in the table.  Although both approaches are more efficient than simple recursion, bottom-up approaches are frequently chosen for large problems because of their superior memory management.\n",

While tabulation computes the results from the smallest, due to this it avoids recursion and makes better use of memory, but it is harder to understand than the other two."
